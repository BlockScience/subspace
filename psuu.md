## Simulation Complexity

- Controllable Parameter Combinations: 23,328
- Environmental Parameter Combinations: 9
- Sweep Combinations: 209,952
- MC Runs: 3
- Total Trajectories: 629,856
- Timesteps: 1,096
- Total State Measurements: 690,322,176

## Performance Measurements
- Execution Time on a Mac M1, 4 Jobs: 274,000 measurements on 250 trajectories in 232 seconds
  - 1,181 M/s
  - 295 M/(J*s)
  - Under the current numbers, the full simulation would take 162 hours to execute.
  - If executed with 100 Jobs, it would take 6.5 hours to execute.
