*A stock and flow description of the SSC token dynamics being generated by the Subspace Economic Network Digital Twin. 

The above model displays the SSC stocks, flows, and metrics that are defined in this software package. The purpose of this package is the generation of datasets that may be analyzed to discover insights about the system. Model development was at first motivated by the development of various specific experiments, and later adapted to a general workflow for parameter selection known as the Parameter Selection Under Uncertainty Framework, or PSUU. In addition to the data generating model package, there are workflows and analysis results provided in the form of jupyter notebooks. For convenience, the results of the notebooks can be viewed directly on github in the browser.

## Introduction

The Subspace Economic Model is a Digital Twin Stock & Flow representation for the SSC token dynamics as they flow through Subspace's distinct mechanisms. The parameters, mechanisms and their constituent logic are based on The Subnomicon and Token Economics design documents provided by the Subspace Team. 

The digital twin is implemented as a python software package that enables data
generation and analysis using cadcad and other python libraries. Model
construction and data generation are performed using cadCAD. Research analysis
is performed using python data analysis pipelines and machine learning for the
purpose of selecting configuration parameters that increase the likelihood of
achieving desired goals.


#### Economic Modeling with cadCAD

Complex Adaptive Dynamics Computer-Aided Design (cadCAD) is a python based
modeling framework for modeling, simulation, and validation of complex systems
designs.

Given a model of a complex system, cadCAD can simulate the impact that a set of
actions might have on it. This helps users make informed, rigorously tested
decisions on how best to modify or interact with the system in order to achieve
their goals. cadCAD supports different system modeling approaches and can be
easily integrated with common empirical data science workflows. Monte Carlo
methods, A/B testing, and parameter sweeping features are natively supported.

#### Model Terminology
- **Fees**: The payments for transactions on the network.
- **Rewards**: The compensation for the work performed by the participants of the network via the issuance of the newly minted tokens by the protocol.
- **Issuance:** The amount of tokens minted as a Reward per block, total for all recipients.
- **Proposer:** Farmer who won the block solution challenge.
- **Voter**: Farmer who won the vote solution challenge. The current ratio is, on average, 9 votes per block.
- **State:** All state values of the system at a particular timestep.
- **Parameters:** Inputs to the model fixed over a run.
- **Functional Parameters:** Parameters that are callable, used to introduce stochasticity, behavioral logic, and mechanisms like the issuance function.
- **Logic:** State update and policy functions that define how the system state updates given its current state and parameterization.
- **Run:** Executing a model from its initial state, through T timesteps.
- **Monte Carlo:** Collecting multiple runs over a single parameterization.
- **Subset:** A particular parameterization of the model that may be probed using Monte Carlo.
- **Sweep:** Systematically varying parameter values to explore their impact on the model through multiple runs.
- **Timestep:** A discrete time interval at which the system's state is updated.
- **Simulation:** Running the model over parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo runs.
- **Experiment:** A structured set of simulation runs designed to test specific hypotheses or explore the effects of varying parameters.
- **Trajectory:** The path taken by the system's state over time during a single run.
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator):** A metric used to evaluate the system's performance in achieving its objectives.
- **Success Criteria:** Predefined conditions that determine whether the simulation results are considered successful.
- **PSuU (Parameter Selection under Uncertainty):** A methodology for selecting robust parameters while considering system uncertainties.

|  [types.py](subspace_model/types.py)  |  Type definitions for the model state and parameters.  |
|  [const.py](subspace_model/const.py)  |  System constants  |
|  [params.py](subspace_model/params.py)  |  System parameters, environmental parameters, and governance surface.  |
|  [state.py](subspace_model/state.py)  |  System inital state.  |
|  [logic.py](subspace_model/logic.py)  |  Policy and state update logic. |
|  [structure.py](subspace_model/structure.py)  |  The block update structure of the model.  |
|  [\_\_main\_\_.py](subspace_model/__main__.py)  |  The command line interface to the subspace model.  |
|  [experiments/experiment.py](subspace_model/experiments/experiment.py)  |  Defines experiments such as standard run and psuu.  |

#### Goals of the System

The purpose of the economic model is to enable the subspace team to optimize the following goals given their choices of initialization parameters for the system.

1. **Rational Economic Incentives** 
    - Ensuring the economic parameters encourage behaviors supporting the network's long-term viability and growth.
    - Incentives should be proportional to effort. 
    - Participation is smooth.
2. **Community Incentivization** 
    - Creating incentives that encourage participation from all defined stakeholders (farmers, operators, nominators).
    - Community owned supply should be maximized
    - Rewards should be spread across as many actors as possible
    - Early adopters should be incentivized
3. **Supply and Demand Equilibrium / Distributional Equilibrium** 
    - Balancing the issuance and distribution of tokens to support both the network's scalability and the fair distribution of resources among participants.
    - Increase in supply (eg. space pledged and operator pools) should track increases in demand (eg. storage & compute fees).

#### Methodology

For further information on the methodology used in this modeling work, please refer to the [Subspace PSUU Work Plan Methodology Document](resources/subspace-psuu-work-plan-methodology.md).



## Background

#### Subspace

> Subspace is the first layer-one blockchain that can fully resolve the
> blockchain trilemma. Subspace is built from first principles to
> simultaneously achieve scalability, security and decentralization. At its core,
> Subspace introduces a novel storage-based consensus protocol that separates
> consensus from execution. This proposer-builder separation allows Subspace to
> independently scale transaction throughput and storage requirements while
> maintaining a fully decentralized blockchain. 

-[Subspace Subnomicon](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/intro)

#### Aligning Incentives for Optimal Scalability

> Subspace includes a novel algorithm to dynamically adjust the cost of
> blockspace in response to changes in supply and demand to economically secure
> the network in an open environment. Such adjustment naturally keeps the network
> incentive compatible for farmers, providing storage and data availability
> bandwidth and for operators providing raw compute power.
> 
> Subspace creates the world's first two-sided marketplace for blockspace,
> allowing it to have a dynamic on-chain cost-of-blockspace and a stable
> off-chain price-of-blockspace without relying on centralized control or
> coordination. On one side are the farmers, who collectively supply blockspace
> bandwidth through their storage of the blockchain history. On the other side
> are dApp developers and users, who demand blockspace to deploy and run their
> applications. Subspace's marketplace algorithm adjusts the on-chain
> cost-of-blockspace paid out to farmers based on real-time supply and demand.
> When demand is high, the cost rises to incentivize more farmers to join. When
> demand is low, the cost falls to disincentivize over-investment in storage.
> This dynamic adjustment process occurs transparently on-chain through the
> protocol rules.
> 
> When combined with existing scalability frameworks, Subspace can achieve linear
> scaling of the blockspace as more nodes join the network without sacrificing
> security or decentralization.
